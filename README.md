# Mycelia LIVEBITE 
Mycelia LIVEBITE is a one year experiment with Imogen Heap, where her live recorded song Half Life is being “crowdfunded” through a smart contract on the public Ethereum blockchain. It's one specific use case for how Mycelia Creative Passport can create a new structure for music and disrupt the music industry.

Fans at the concert of the recording were offered a chance to contribute a symbolic amount of money and in turn receive a split of the revenue from streaming the song during a year.

Testing a new way to fund music makers independently from record labels, keeping the security, adding transparency. Streaming data will be visualised for the fans to get insight how money flows in the music industry today.

Will it illustrate the problem with current artist funding? Or will fans get rich from their split? Year 2019 will reveal. Our hypothesis is that the revenue left for the music makers from traditional streaming is very little and this experiment will let fans be a part of that experience. But can blockchain facilitate an alternative?
